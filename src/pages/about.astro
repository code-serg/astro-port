      Hello, I'm Sergio. I'm an experienced software developer with passion for
      web development and open source software.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      I have a degree in Computer Science and I've been working with software
      and IT services for over 10 years. I've worked with a variety of
      technologies and programming languages, but I'm currently focused on
      JavaScript and its ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills and I love to get in
      the proverbial rabbit hole of new technologies.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
